# VLOCA-portal
Jekyll site for the Flemish government "Vlaamse Open City Architectuur" initiative.

## Branches
Three branches are significant:
* dev: gathers commits from developers. Start your work here. Always unless you know your specific work should not start here.
* test: after checks by ABB this branch deploys to the test site URL.
* master: deploys to https://www.vlaanderen.be/vloca
## Build the site
Download the repository.
Install jekyll.
Run `jekyll build` in the repository root.
Serve the files in `/_site` on a webserver or use `jekyll s` and browse to https://localhost:4000 (unless you've changed that).
